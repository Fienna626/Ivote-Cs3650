1) Configure the question types and candidate answers. It should support 2 types of
questions: 1) multiple-choice question (more than one choice can be chosen including
one choice); 2) single choice question (only one choice can be chosen). For each type,
you can configure the candidate answers, such as “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, or “1.
Right”, “2. Wrong”, etc.

2) Allow students to submit answers. Every student has a unique ID (String), and can
submit an answer to the iVote service.

3) The Voting Service can be first configured with a given question type and candidate
answers. Then, it can start accepting submissions from students. The important thing to
keep in mind about accepting submissions is that each student can only submit one
answer. If multiple submissions are received from the same student, only the last
submission will be counted.

4) The Voting Service can also output the statistics of the submission results. You don’t
have to use the graphical interface. Simply use the standard output (System.out) to
print out the count for each answer. For example, “A : 5, B : 12”, or “1. Right :
15, 2. Wrong : 20”. Feel free to customize the format for your output.

5) You need a SimulationDriver to automatically simulate the whole process. Basically,
the driver will 1) create a question type and configure the answers; 2) configure the
question for iVote Service; 3) randomly generate a number students and the answers; 4)
submit all the students’ answers to iVote Service; 5) call the Voting Service output
function to display the result.
